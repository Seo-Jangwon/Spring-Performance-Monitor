## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components
1. **PerformanceAspect**
   - AOP-based performance measurement
   - Method execution time tracking
   - Thread state monitoring

2. **ThreadMonitorService**
   - Thread pool management
   - CPU/User time measurement
   - Thread state tracking

3. **MemoryMonitorService**
   - Heap/Non-heap memory monitoring
   - GC metrics collection
   - Memory usage analysis

4. **WebSocket Handler**
   - Real-time metrics transmission
   - Bi-directional communication
   - Session management

### 2. Key Features Implementation
1. **@PerformanceMeasure Annotation**
   ```java
   @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
   public @interface PerformanceMeasure {
       String value() default "";
   }
   ```

2. **Endpoint Scanner**
   - Automatic API endpoint detection
   - Request/Response type analysis
   - Service method relationship mapping

## Usage

### 1. Add `@PerformanceMeasure` to target methods
   ```java
   @PerformanceMeasure("API Response Time Test")
   @GetMapping("/api/test")
   public ResponseEntity<?> testEndpoint() {
       // Method implementation
   }
   ```

### 2. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/performanceMeasure`

## Branch Rules

### 1. This project follows the Git Flow branching model

- `develop` (default): Main development branch
- `main`: Production-ready state
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### 2. Branch Naming Convention
- feature: `feature/add-memory-monitoring`
- bugfix: `bugfix/fix-thread-metrics`
- hotfix: `hotfix/critical-memory-leak`
- release: `release/v1.0.0`

### 3. Protection Rules
- `develop` and `main`
    - Require pull request reviews
    - No direct pushes
    - Must be up to date before merging
    - Status checks must pass

### 4. Commit Convention
```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
style: Format code
refactor: Refactor code
test: Add tests
chore: Update build tasks
